# README

I don't know how JWT works, I don't know how HTMX works. This repo outlines my process of learning how JWT and HTMX work by creating a simple web application using go(golang). 

## libs/frameworks

- [gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin)
- [JWT](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v5)
- [HTMX](https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx)

## project configuration 

## Folder layout
```bash

```



../src/ 
main.go 
  - This function will set up the router and call out to the Routers package in /Routers/
