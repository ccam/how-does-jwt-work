# Log for 3-9-25

Today I created all directories and files I think I'll need. This will need to be changed as I understand project better. This could be the start of a project boiler plate?

I think to understand how JWT works and how a secure application works I should make the following pages/routes:

- A landing page that has a log in function/page.
- An admin page that the user can only see once logged in AND has a admin role.
- A page that regular logged in users can access
- Maybe a page that the user can update their login info?

## Goals for next session

- [ ] get an understanding on how to build HTMX pages and how to serve them.
- [ ] Set build the following:
  - [ ] index.html
  - [ ] login.html
  - [ ] admin.html
