# Log for 3-9-25

Today I set created all directories and files I think I'll need. This will need to be changed. This could be the start of a project boiler plate? 

## Goals for next session. 

- [ ] get an understanding on how to build HTMX pages and how to serve them. 
- [ ] Set up Router and protected paths.
