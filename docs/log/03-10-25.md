# Log for 03.10.25

## Goals for this session

- [ ] get an understanding on how to build HTMX pages and how to serve them.
- [ ] Set build the following:
  - [ ] index.html
  - [ ] login.html
  - [ ] admin.html

## Lessons Learned

- Returning HTML with gin
  gin returns "templates" or just html pages. [The docs](https://gin-gonic.com/docs/examples/html-rendering/) you can use .html files and .tmpl files.

  You have to use the `LoadHTMLGlob()` or the `LoadHTMLFiles()` function to register the templates for gin to use. Then you can serve them to the client by using the `c.HTML()` function.
